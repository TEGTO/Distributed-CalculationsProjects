Ð°) The first problem is about Winnie the Pooh. At the end of the month, the bees calculated the damage caused 
by Winnie the Pooh in the forest and decided to find him and punish him. To search for the bear, they divided the forest into sections, 
each combed by one flock of bees. 
If the bear is found in its area, the flock carries out a demonstrative punishment and returns to the hive.
If the area is checked and Winnie the Pooh is not found, the flock also returns to the hive. 
You need to create a multithreaded application that simulates the actions of bees. 
Use the task portfolio paradigm to solve the problem.
